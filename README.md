Tom here and I'm always keen on improving my (mostly) smart home, Open Source projects and learning new skills/techniques/improving. Much beneficial to my professional career as senior consultant and Technical Team lead @ [Sue B.V.](https://github.com/Sue-unix-experts). I'm result-driven, committed and will use any and all skills at hand to get things done. (And yes that is a reference to GTD as well).

Personally I have experiences in most Linuces & Unices (UNIX/Linux), most hardware platforms (x86, ARM, etc.) and severall languages (python, PHP, some go and C*).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on github.com/plugwise, getting [Sue](https://github.com/Sue-unix-experts) repositories in place and reviewing and committing to github.com/home-assistant
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning more about python, testing code, building pipelines and improving my containerizing skills (mostly including Docker and k8s nowadays)
