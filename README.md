Tom here and I'm always keen on improving my (mostly) smart home, Open Source projects and learning new skills/techniques/improving. Much beneficial to my professional career, currently as support engineer, former as senior consultant and later technical team lead. I'm result-driven, committed and will use any and all skills at hand to get things done. (And yes that is a reference to GTD as well).

Personally I have experiences in most Linuces & Unices (UNIX/Linux), most hardware platforms (x86, ARM, etc.) and severall languages (python, PHP, some go and C*).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [github.com/plugwise](https://github.com/plugwise), reviewing and committing to [github.com/home-assistant](github.com/home-assistant)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning more about python, testing code, building pipelines and improving my containerizing skills (mostly including Docker and k8s nowadays)
