Tom here and I'm always keen on improving my (mostly) smart home, Open Source projects and learning new skills/techniques/improving. Much beneficial to my professional career, currently as technical solutions engineer, former as senior consultant and later technical team lead. I'm result-driven, committed and will use any and all skills at hand to get things done. (And yes that is a reference to GTD as well).

Personally I have experiences in most Linuces & Unices (UNIX/Linux), most hardware platforms (x86, ARM, etc.) and severall languages (python, PHP, some go and C*).
